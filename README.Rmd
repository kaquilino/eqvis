[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kaquilino/eqvis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kaquilino/eqvis)

The `eqvis` package provides functions for cleaning and plotting NOAA significant earthquake dataset using either a timeline or map. The earthquake data must be cleaned first using the `eq_clean_data` function. With this function, the country and colon are removed from the `LOCATION_NAME` and it is converted to title case. A new `DATE` column is derived from the date parts (`YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`). `LATITUDE` and `LONGITUDE` are converted to numeric.
  
The NOAA earthquake dataset can be accessed from: https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/results?type_0=Exact&query_0=$ID&t=101650&s=13&d=189&dfn=signif.txt. This dataset contains information about 5,933 earthquakes around the world over an approximately 4,000 year time span. This package was developed to work with years AC only.  

## Timeline Info

A timeline can be produced using `ggplot2` with the `geom_timeline`/`stat_timeline` functions. It will plot a timeline with points for each earthquake and can optionally include a size and color/fill aesthectics. If `xmin` and `xmax` aesthetics are provided, `stat_timeline` will subset the data. The `geom_timeline_label` function can be used to add a label geom. It print the label aesthetic for the top `n_max` earthquakes in terms of magnitude.

## Map Info

A map can be produced using eq_map(). It will display circle markers at the lat/lon locations with a radius based on the magnitude of the earthquake and popup text reflecting the annotation column provided. An optional eq_create_label function is provided that generate label text using the location name, magnitude and deaths for the earthquake.

## Sample Dataset

A `sample_eq` dataset is provided. It is a subset of the complete NOAA dataset, filtered for `COUNTRY` values `USA` and `MEXICO` and `YEAR` 2000-2017.
